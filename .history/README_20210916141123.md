# InterBack Api

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit (baseUrl) [`localhost:4000/api/`](http://localhost:4000/api/) from your postman/insomnia.

#### INTRO TO API
<i>
  The api can accept three types of users, Super User `role: 1`, store attendant `role: 3` and Warehouse attendant `role: 2` but the api allows you to user super user in place of warehouse attendant.

  The link to the hosted application on heroku is (baseUrl) I will use baseUrl to refer to the link in my examples 
  [`https://inter-back.herokuapp.com/api/`](https://inter-back.herokuapp.com/api/).

  By default the api has some data already pre-inserted and the data id superuser with the id of 2 and store attendant with the is of 1 you can access the users using `GET baseUrl/users/1`. To access all users in the database use `GET baseUrl/user`
</i>

##### LOGIN 
_To login to the api use `POST baseUrl/users/auth/login` and provide the data as shown below_

{
	"user": {
		"email": "kelraf11746@gmail.com",
		"password": "kelraf"
	}
}
_use the exact data becouse this is a superuser in the api_

_The response is as below_

{
  "message": "Login Successful.",
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJpbnRlckJhY2siLCJleHAiOjE2MzQyMDU1NzIsImlhdCI6MTYzMTc4NjM3MiwiaXNzIjoiaW50ZXJCYWNrIiwianRpIjoiNmFmNzlmYTEtMGE2NS00OTRiLTlkNjctYzI2ZmM1ODU4MjBjIiwibmJmIjoxNjMxNzg2MzcxLCJzdWIiOiIyIiwidHlwIjoiYWNjZXNzIn0.x9ETeq9TbTGfjw83_rinbCUSOKhoMmg2Xf3IoCPvUyBRBJ-0ZK6KWaxu8HfLY4G6Oj4sQemqdxgkbmx2UW4QNA",
  "user": {
    "email": "kelraf11746@gmail.com",
    "id": 2,
    "name": "kelvin Raphael",
    "password_confirmation": null,
    "role": 1
  }
}

_Take the toke and use it to access the rest of the endpoints since they are protected_

##### CREATING A STORE
_To create a store visit `POST baseUrl/stores` with the data as below_

{
	"store": {
		"user_id": 1,
		"store_name": ""
	}
}

_There are other endpoints to work with stores as described in [`these section`](#stores)_


##### CREATE A STORE ATTENDANT
_Since now we have a store lets create a store attendant. We will first create user with the `role: 3` using the endpoint as `POST baseUrl/users/auth/register` and data as below_

{
	"user": {
		"name": "kelvin Raphael",
		"email": "kelraf11746@gmail.com",
		"password": "kelraf",
		"role": 3 <bold> (Remember the roles here) <bold>,
		"password_confirmation": "kelraf"
	}
}

_We will then create a relationship between the user we just created and a store using the endpoint `POST baseUrl/storeattendants` and data as shown below_

{
	"storeattendant": {
		"user_id": 2,
		"store_id": 1
	}
}

_You can see the rest of the endpoints to work with store attendants in [`these section`](#storeattendants)_


##### CREATING WAREHOUSE PRODUCT
_To add a product to warehouse you can use `POST baseUrl/warehouseproducts` with the data as shown below_

{
	"warehouse_product": {
		"user_id": 2,
		"product_name": "Fanta",
		"category": "1 litre",
		"quantity": 9000
	}
}

_For more information about dealing with warehouse products see [`these section`](#warehouseproducts)_
